# Strongly Connected Components in A Directed Graph

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice coding up the algorithm to compute strongly connected components (SCC). Students then apply their algorithms to a directed graph that contains 875714 vertices and compute the sizes of its 5 largest SCCs.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
