# Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in A Directed Graph

In this project I coded up the algorithm to compute strongly connected components (SCC). I then used the algorithms to compute the size of the five largest SCCs of a directed graph that had 875714 vertices.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
